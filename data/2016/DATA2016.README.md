### Coverage
***2016-01-04 to 2016-07-25***

#### 1. Days of activity:
* 84

```sql
SELECT count(id), date_trunc('day', changed) FROM rem_status_log GROUP BY (date_trunc('day', changed)) ORDER BY date_trunc('day', changed);
```
#### 2. Updates:
* DIMS: 19,523
* BPBD: 2,285 (operators)
* Total: 21,808

```sql
SELECT count(id), username FROM rem_status_log GROUP BY (username);
```
#### 3. Last update by DIMS (discontinued)
* 2016-02-12 17:15:06

```sql
SELECT max(changed) FROM rem_status_log WHERE username = 'DIMS';
```

#### 4. Number of flood events (coarse) as classified by BPBD operators
* 1,268
* Not including DIMS

```sql
SELECT count(id) FROM rem_status_log WHERE username != 'DIMS' AND state > 0;
```

#### 5. Areas (RW districts) affected
* Total number: 534

```sql
SELECT count(id), rw FROM rem_status_log WHERE username != 'DIMS' AND state > 0 GROUP BY rw ORDER BY count(id) DESC;
```

* 325 RWs flooded only once
* 1 RW flooded 28 times

#### Flood heights

#### Event data
GeoJSON generated using `pier get-floodstate`

Files represent RW districts which experienced flooding within the specified 24 hour period. Flood height data is downsampled to hourly frequency, thus each RW district includes 24 flood state attributes. RW districts not affected within the 24 hour period are not included.
