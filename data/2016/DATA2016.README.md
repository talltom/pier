```sql
SELECT a.num_floods as num_floods_over_season, count(a.num_floods) num_areas_affected
FROM (
  SELECT count(id) as num_floods, rw
  FROM rem_status_log
  WHERE username != 'DIMS' AND state > 0 GROUP BY rw ORDER BY count(id) DESC)
  as a
GROUP BY a.num_floods
ORDER BY a.num_floods;
```

* Total area flooded

#### Flood heights

#### Event data
GeoJSON generated using `pier get-floodstate`

Files represent RW districts which experienced flooding within the specified 24 hour period. Flood height data is downsampled to hourly frequency, thus each RW district includes 24 flood state attributes. RW districts not affected within the 24 hour period are not included.
